# A-portfolio-project-using-MS-SQL-server-and-Power-BI
In this project i have used a sample database dataset from microsoft for MS SQL server.I created this project to showcase my sql and power bi skills.
Things I did in this project was as following:

1]Primary goal was to create a sales dashboard/report using power bi. So to do it, started with identifying the neccesary tables from database which were extracted using 
MS SQL server management studio and saved in .csv files. Data extraction included using a lot of tools in SQL like LEFT JOIN, LEFT, ON,GETDATE,subqueries, etc. Them we 
have created a data model in power bi and a sales dashboard was created.
